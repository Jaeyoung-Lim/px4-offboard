# px4-offboard
This `repository` contains a python examples for offboard control on ROS2 with [PX4](https://px4.io/)

The `px4_offboard` package contains the following nodes
- `offboard_control.py`: Example of offboard position control using position setpoints
- `visualizer.py`: Used for visualizing vehicle states in Rviz

## Setup
Add the repository to the ros2 workspace
```
git clone https://github.com/Jaeyoung-Lim/px4-offboard.git
```

## Running
You will make use of 3 different terminals to run the offboard demo.

On the first terminal, run a SITL instance from the PX4 Autopilot firmware.
```
make px4_sitl gazebo
```

On the second terminal terminal, run the micro-ros-agent which will perform the mapping between Micro XRCE-DDS and RTPS. So that ROS2 Nodes are able to communicate with the PX4 micrortps_client.
```
micro-ros-agent udp4 --port 8888
```

In order to run the offboard position control example, open a third terminal and run the the node.
This runs two ros nodes, which publishes offboard position control setpoints and the visualizer.
```
ros2 launch px4_offboard offboard_position_control.launch.py
```

In order to just run the visualizer,
```
ros2 launch px4_offboard visualize.launch.py
```
